I am currently working as a Data Engineer and Data Analyst, besides I am a cross-domain engineer.:smile:<br>
I had experienced in various domains, such as genetic engineering, metabolic engineering, fermentation engineering, process engineering, solvent recycling engineering,  composite materials engineering, and full stack developer. 

Base on the above experience, I am good at communicating with people who work in different fields. Because my experience in multiple domains and I am always thinking out of the box, I could provide some fresh ideas for a new project or solution during brainstorming.

The above experience does not seem to be related, but they truly connect each other by **DATA**.<br>
That's the **BIG WHY** that I am heading towards becoming a Data Scientist at this time.
