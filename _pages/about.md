I am currently working as a Data Engineer and Data Analyst, besides I am a cross-domain engineer.:smile:<br>

I had experienced in various domains, such as genetic engineering, metabolic engineering, fermentation engineering, filament spinning engineering, solvent recycling engineering, composite materials engineering, and full-stack development. 

Base on the above experiences, I am good at communicating with people who work in different fields. Because of my experience in multiple domains and I am always thinking out of the box, I could provide some fresh ideas for a new project or solutions during brainstorming.

The above experiences do not seem to be related, but they truly connect each other by **DATA**.<br>

## EXPERIENCE

- **Data Engineer**
  - Using machine learning to solve real-world problems. 
  - Building and deploying the end to end machine learning web application.
- **Chemical Engineer**
  - Prototyping the products of the thermoplastic composite materials.
  - Worked with the solvent recovery system which maximum capacity is 400 m<sup>3</sup>/day.
  - Dedicated to the manufacturing process of regenerated cellulose filament. Besides, transferred the key technology from the pilot-scale to the mass production.
- **Reserch Assistant**
  - Dedicated to Microbial Metabolism, Genetic Engineering and Bacterial Fermentation.
